        <h1>Our Company</h1>
        <img src="../assets/images/coffeeshop.png">
        <P>Our story begins in 1971 along the cobblestone streets of <br>  seattle’s historic pike place market. It was here where<br> starbucks opened its first store, offering fresh-roasted coffee<br> beans, tea and spices from around the world for our<br> customers to take home. Our name was inspired by the classic<br> tale, “moby-dick,” evoking the seafaring tradition of the early<br> coffee traders.
        </P>
        <br>
        <p>Ten years later, a young new yorker named howard schultz<br> would walk through these doors and become captivated with <br>starbucks coffee from his first sip. After joining the company<br> in 1982, a different cobblestone road would lead him to <br>another discovery. It was on a trip to milan in 1983 that<br> howard first experienced italy’s coffeehouses, and he<BR> returned to seattle inspired to bring the warmth and artistry<br> of its coffee culture to starbucks. By 1987, we swapped our<br> brown aprons for green ones and embarked on our next<br> chapter as a coffeehouse.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Starbucks would soon expand to chicago and vancouver,<br> canada and then on to california, washington, d.C. And new york.<br> By 1996, we would cross the pacific to open our first<br> store in japan, followed by europe in 1998 and china in 1999.<br> Over the next two decades, we would grow to welcome<br> millions of customers each week and become a part of the<br> fabric of tens of thousands of neighborhoods all around the<br> world. In everything we do, we are always dedicated to our<br> mission: with every cup, with every conversation, with every<br> community - we nurture the limitless possibilities of human connection.

        <h1>Coffee & Craft</h1>
        
        <p>It takes many hands to craft the perfect cup of coffee – <br>from the farmers who tend to the red-ripe coffee cherries,<br> to the master roasters who coax the best from every bean,<br> and to the barista who serves it with care. We are<br> committed to the highest standards of quality and service,<br> embracing our heritage while innovating to create new<br> experiences to savor.</p>

        <h1>Our Partners</h1>
    
        <p>We like to say that we are not in the coffee business<br> serving people, but in the people business serving coffee.<br> Our employees – who we call partners – are at the heart of<br> the Starbucks experience. We are committed to making our<br> partners proud and investing in their health, well-being and<br> success and to creating a culture of belonging where<br> everyone is welcome. </p>
